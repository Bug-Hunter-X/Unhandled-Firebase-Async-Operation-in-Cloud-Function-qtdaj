This repository demonstrates a common error in Firebase Cloud Functions related to unhandled asynchronous operations. The `createUser.js` file showcases the buggy code, where the promise returned by `admin.auth().createUser()` is not properly handled. The `createUserSolution.js` file provides the corrected code with proper error handling and promise resolution using `.then()` and `.catch()`.  This bug can manifest in various ways, including unexpected null values, incorrect data updates, or silent failures. The solution highlights best practices for handling asynchronous operations in Firebase to prevent these issues.
